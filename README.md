# Project Proposal - Computational Genomics 
## Team members: 
Kiki Change, Jeana Yee, Mariya Kazachkova, Kevin Jza Joo 

## Research Goals:

### Method we want to develop:
We are looking to create a method to detect contamination in data sets of sequencing reads. 

### How to evaluate method:
We believe that the easiest way to evaluate our method is to start by running our algorithm with data sets of sequencing reads that are known to contain certain contaminents and making sure that we are getting the correct results (so the correct contaminants are being identified). Once this is working without any errors, we can move on to looking at data sets where the status of contamination is unknown.
